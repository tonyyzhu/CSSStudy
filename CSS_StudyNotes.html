    <h1>Tools for CSS</h1>

    <h3>22/07/2014</h3>

    <p>This course is from 2006, which is really old. It suggested to install Web Developers Toolbar into Firefox, that I didn't.</p>

    <p>Well, I installed the "Web Developer Tools" after Firebug. This tools is the native Firefox tool, which is in the same fashion as Firebug. I can't see any advantage of using it instead of Firebug...</p>

    <p>BTW, the machine becomes slow after I installed the HP device drivers for this Vista laptop. It improves the screen size from 1024x600, to 1328x768, which is great. But, the fan of CPU runs all the time, and 1GB RAM used more than 83% all the time.  </p>

    <p>What I added are standard software for a Windows Laptop:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>Microsoft Security Essentials</li>
    	<li>CCleaner</li>
    	<li>Firefox</li>
    	<li>Chrome</li>
    	<li>Notepad++</li>
    	<li>Sublime Text 3059</li>
    	<li>7zip</li>
    	<li>Foxit Reader</li>
    	<li>Time Doctor Pro</li>
    	<li>VLC Player</li>
    	<li>GitHub for Windows</li>
            <li>Windows Live 2011 (auto updated)</li>
            <li>CPUID (but found that this one using DDR2 PC2-6400(400 MHZ) RAM, this is Intel Core2 Duo CPU T5870@2.00GHz, 1GB, 32-bit OS, that constantly short of RAM &. run into speed bumber. $28 to add an extra GB RAM from RAMCity.)</li>
            <li>Brother CW990 All-in-one Printer</li>
            <li>Windows Power Shell 2.0</li>
            <li>Microsoft Silverlight</li>
            <li>Windows Updates for Vista, including SP2, .Net 4.5.1</li>
            <li>HP Webcam Driver, HP Quick Launch Buttons, IDT Audio etc</li>
            <li>The Ethernet driver is not specifically loaded, and it was initially connected to home using WiFi. The outlook is that I need to reboot the laptop after WiFi disconnected or turned off. Otherwise it won't find the network connection. Or showing the Wired Connection or Card in any shape or form. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>From above, the GitHub Shell does not work. I also tried GitHub ATOM, which does not work as well. It recommended to be installed using 'cocco', which requires M$ PowerShell (that I didn't install) and Chrome(which is why I installed Chrome here, otherwise I won't). And, I didn't port all my Google settings back to this laptop, because I intend to use it as a study tool only, not a daily usage tool.</p>

    <p>BTW, I found out how to get updated files from GitHub on another laptop: git fetch upstream. It is to pull in changes not present in your local repository, without modifying your files. I will test it out on that Windows laptop after I added this and commited and pushed to GitHub.</p>

    <h2 id="latest"><a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/learning">Please go here to find out all latest CSS learning materials and standards</a></h2>

    <h3>XHTML and CSS, from 2006</h3>

    <p>There are two types of elements: unreplaceable elements such as 'div', 'a', 'p'; and replaceable emelents such as 'img'; in HTML.</p>

    <p>The format is '&ltimg src="picture.jpg" alt="" /&gt'. 'src' is the attribute, 'picture.jpg' is the value. </p>

    <h3>CSS terminalogy:</h3>

    <p>Look at a typical CSS statement: h1 {color: #333; font-size: x-large; }.  'color' is called 'Property'; after ":" is the value such as '#333'. Something such as 'x-large' is also called 'key words'. The pair of "color: #333;" is called 'Declaration', which has to be terminated by ';'. The whole {color: #333; font-size: x-large; } is called 'Declaration block'. 'h1' is called 'Selector'. The whole thing (a selector plus a declaration block) is called a 'Rule'. </p>

    <h3>CSS Linking</h3>

    <p>Useing the following for embedded CSS style: &ltstyle type="text/css"&gt   'copy CSS file content here' &lt/style  &gt. BTW, embedded CSS are put into the head section. And, just put a space in-between elements, to present the path to the final element, so that you won't have confusions, even later you added something when you can't remember what was inside the CSS file.</p>

    <p>Using the following for linking to external CSS file: &ltlink rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/base.css" media="all" /&gt. </p>

    <p>You can link multiple external CSS files, such as one for style, another for fonds, third just for contacts, etc.; using same copies of link statement (but different CSS file names)</p>

    <p>You can not only implement background for the Body section, but also for each and every element you could specify, if you want. Using 'div' is a common way create an element in HTML, so that you can reference to it to do something else, such as apply CSS styles to that section.</p>

    <p>Using embedded style tab, you can use '@import url(styles/base.css);" statement to add stylesheet. You can also add multiple statements, such as '@import url(styles/secondary.css);'. You could even add embedded CSS stylesheet in the next line etc.</p>

    <p>It is personal choice which method you use. Normally people use 'link' statement for external CSS files.</p>

    <h3>Selectors</h3>

    <p>ID selector is a commonly used method to mark a section. ID got to be unique. In CSS file, just add "#" in front of ID, it is easily refer to that ID. BTW, you can combine DOM element name with the ID inside CSS file for selector. The only issue is that there should be no space between DOM element and '#'ID. BTW, selector is case sensitive as well.</p>

    <p>Class selectors are use '.' plus class name to mark section or sections that has common CSS properties. You could also add element name in front of '.' without space, as selector to specify the class inside that element only. </p>

    <p>Don't 'over' class: If you already added class to 'ul' or 'ol' tag, you don't need to add that class into each and every 'li' tag underneath.  It is much cleaner to read and refer to. Unless you are going to put in different class or ID into the 'li' tag. </p>

    <p>You could use 'class="first urgent"' to set both class 'first' and class 'urgent' into the same tag/element, and then use different rules about each class. The final result would be combine both together. </p>

    <p>Group selectors can combine individual selector together for the same common properties. Such as "h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, div#content p, title {text-transform: uppercase;}". This was the one that tutor told me to do when using ',' to add two selectors together for JavaScript code - but he didn't mention 'group selector' as a method. </p>

    <p>Three sources of style:
    	<ol>
    		<li>Author styles (web site style), which is what the web page coder specified.<br /><br /></li>
    		<li>User Agent styles (browser style), default settings of the user's browser. In Firefox, it is under menu --> View --> Page Style --> 'basic page style' (default). (Another choice is 'no style'.)<br /><br /></li>
    		<li>User(reader) styles: User style is on top of browser style, such as 'links should always underlined, and no one should change it'. BTW, User Style Sheet is very rare to be seen, because most people don't know it exists. A common usage is that colour-blind people will define their own user style, that will turn everything into black/white format. <br /><br />

    		Old version of browsers (before 2006) were using 'html.css' and other .css files in 'resources' folder for User Style. But the modern ones no longer has these .css files installed as part of the package. It has to be done through the settings from menus and options etc. <br /><br />

    		At this Windows Vista machine, on Chrome, I disabled Adobe Flash and others in Chrome://Plugin, and in Chrome://settings I disabled Javascript, download image, disable cookie, and other things and privacy that is not necessary. Then it is really fast to load those Chinese Noval webpages without those annoying pop-ups, ads, flashing video game animations, and other porny sick pictures. All those things will put the laptop into freezing if open more than 5 tabs at same time (as Core-2 and 1GB RAM Vista PC, that memory usage could be over 93% to 100%). Now it is OK to open more than 10 tabs at same time, and max RAM usage is 73% and CPU is less than 20%. Well, at least recent learning enabled me to do something right here. <br /><br /></li>
    		<li>User style overrides User Agent style, which will override Author style. This is why it is called Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).</li>
    	</ol>
     </p>

    <p>If you has the following: "h1 {background: green;}", but h1 section didn't turn green. You can try to add "!important" as following: "h1 {background: green !important;}". It would force it to green. Then you should do troubleshooting, to find out where it was defined as non-green, and then correct the issue and take that  "!important"  out. </p>

    <p>On the other hand, User Style will typically use "!important" in each declaration, so that it would override all other styles; such as in above color-blind case.</p>

    <p>Inheritance: In DOM tree, child elements will inherite those declaritions from parent element, in a common sense way. Borders will not be inherited, but colour and font styles will be. However, if there is a specific style/declaration for a specific element in the child elements, that style will win the competition against the inheritance from parent element. In other ways, directly assigned declaration will win the conflict, as a rule. Even "!important" declared rule won't win in the inheritance, if not in User Style.</p>

    <h3>Layout</h3>

    <p>Border can be placed outside of any element. Padding is between border and the content. Margin is similar to padding, but outside of border. A typical rule would look like this: p {margin: 1em; border: 1px solid #000; padding: 1em;}  </p>

    <ul>
    	<li>Simple Floating: left, right, none(default).  The effect is to move the image box or other kind of box to move to leftest side or the rightest side. None as default means it does not move anywhere and there is no effect here. Syntax: #content img.illus {float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;} <br /><br /></li>
    	<li>Float Layout: use this layout to divide the page into two column views, so that it looks better: <br /><br />
    	#content {float: left; padding: 0 20em 4em 3em; background: #FFA} <br />
    	#sidebar {float:right; width: 17em; margin: 0 0 4em -18em;} <br /><br />
    	Add background into the first part is a good way to do troubleshooting, because it clearly marked the whole section and where its extention area is. This declaration of background can be deleted after all things done. Or, you could put it as part of the design. Put '-18em' (which is less than padding of '20em' of first section) is a good way to 'guru' them together. So that when resizing the window, they won't be separated into two line/sections.
    	</li>
    	<li>For page footer to work, we need to add the following: #footer {margin: 20px; clear:both;}. What 'clear' works, is to cancel out defined 'float', for either 'left', 'right', or 'both'; from margin-top. So after adding above rules for footer, it will goes down to whatever element it followed (such as #content and #sidebar as above). The 'margin' here is for margin-bottom only, because clear is to cancel out margin-top. <br /><br />

    	To make a gap between page footer and sections on top of it, the 'margin-bottom:10px;" or wider, needs to be added into the rules of all sections above it; such as #content and #sidebar as above. <br /><br /></li>
    	<li>Declaration of "overflow: auto;". If you add an div for container to cover both #content and #sidebar area, and add a "border: 2px solid red;" to it, you would notice that the right side border is always 2px or more hidden, unless you move the scrolling over to the right side. <br /><br />
    	The issue is caused by extra space added when using various margins added to various elements (remember margin is outside of border, and padding is between border and content?). To solve this issue, declaration of overflow will be added, which will bring both left and right side of borders into the sightview, no matter how to resize the window. <br /><br />

    	The example is: #container {background: #FCA; border: 2px solid red; overflow: auto;}. <br /><br /></li>
    	<li>Create navigation bar usign ordered list. Assuming ol tag has 'id="navlinks"', try following: #navlinks li {display: inline; list-style: none;}. Display: inline; will show all items of li tags in one line. List-style: none; will get rid of numbers and dot in front of each and every items' innerHTML content. <br /><br />
    	Display has two other values: block and none. Block will display its innerHTML content in a block box (using background colour to verify it. It is to generate a box for this element, but it won't change this element to be a 'block'). "Display: none;" means don't generate this box, that would make everything inside this box disappear on the web page. It is also used to hidden things in menus, or hide things from the page for printing, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="Color">Colors and Backgrounds</h3>

    <p>To have an underline below the title on the web page, it can be easily done using "border-bottom: 1px solid black;", which is just included for the title element's CSS properties, such as for "h3" in this case. </p>

    <p>Five ways to define color in CSS: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyword, such as "black"</li>
            <li>Hex: #FFFFFF (White), #00000 (Black) </li>
            <li>Short Hex: #C30 (only those pairs such as #CC3300 can be shorten to #C30.)  </li>
            <li>RGB Decimal: rgb(255,255,255) (white), rgb(0,0,0) (black). #C30 can be converted to rgb(204, 51, 0), from hex to 10-based system for each digital of Hex. </li>
            <li>RGB Percent: rgb(100%, 100%, 100%) (white), rgb(0%, 0%, 0%) (black). Again, #C30 is rgb(80%, 20%, 0%), because 204/255=0.8, 51/255=0.2, 0/255=0. Don't expect perfect fidelity: some browser would round it up anyway. </li>
        </ul>
    <p>BTW, Adobe Photoshop CS2 has a feature called "Color Picker", that would specify rgb or hex numbers, as well as CMYK style or other styles. In reality, everyone picks a color from a tool like Photoshop, and then write down the color specification given by the tool.</p>

    <p id="css21"><a href="http://w3.org/TR/css21">CSS 2.1 Specification has 17 keywords for color:</a></p>
        <ol>
            <li id="maroon">maroon</li>
            <li id="red">red</li>
            <li id="orange">orange</li>
            <li id="yellow">yellow</li>
            <li id="olive">olive</li>
            <li id="purple">purple</li>
            <li id="fuchsia">fuchsia</li>
            <li id="white">white</li>
            <li id="lime">lime</li>
            <li id="green">green</li>
            <li id="navy">navy</li>
            <li id="blue">blue</li>
            <li id="aqua">aqua</li>
            <li id="teal">teal</li>
            <li id="black">black</li>
            <li id="silver">silver</li>
            <li id="gray">gray</li>
        </ol>

    <p>Background Colour can be defined for various sections, that would effectively cut the page into sections, or boxes (big or small). Then by manipulate the background colour, you can make various effects. Such as make the title background colour of sidebar as the same as main content colour, the sidebar could be visibly cut into more smaller boxes, although logically sidebar is still one section only.    </p>

    <P>Look at <a href="http://www.aqee.net">http://www.vaikan.com/</a>, the M$ Metro flat 2D UI can be created by using clever CSS properties. The site's banner has .branddark {width:100%; background-color: #035553; border-top: 1px solid #035553;}. The border-top is invisible because it is the same colour as background-colour.  Although it has several .css files, others will specify that "background: transparent; border:0; margin: 0; padding: 0; vertical-align: baseline;"; and 'media="all"'. Then, you can put on next layer of boxes on top of this background, by specifying its background-colour, text colour, border and other things. By layered approach, you can easily define a perfect picture with various different colours at different sections, yet has a combined style and colour schemes. "div" tag is a perfection way to create these boxes, along with all other tags (even to 'a' tag, that you can add on various ID and class etc.); and "span" appears to be used for class reference instead. </P>

    <p>Background Image syntax: "background-image: url(images/curl-gray.gif)". The relative url using the syntax as above (location relative to the style sheet at local folder, not to html file), and the image file can be in the format of .jpg, .gif, .png.   </p>

    <p>Background image can be repeated, using "background: repeat;". It can also be "repeat-x", "repeat-y", or "no-repeat" with default/fixed position. By default it is repeated. Check out <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp">W3 School</a> site for more details, and try out their examples. BTW, there are javascript examples underneath as well, that is handy to use to add background information including images etc. It would make generating schemes using JavaScript much faster and easier. I now understand why W3 School web site will always be #1 when searching for HTML or CSS tags.  </p>

    <p>Background position syntax is: "background-position: top center;"; or "50% 0;"; "right center;"; "0 50%" (left center, or left middle); It is honrizonial vertical (left top, which is position sensitive. The default value is 0 0). This one with "background: repeat;" together, is a good way to put watermark into the web page.    </p>

    <p>Add above together, it can be combined like this: "#content {background: rgb(85%, 85%, 85%) url(images/curl-gray.gif) repeat 0 0;}". It looks much neat and less typing errors.   </p>

    <h3>Typography</h3>

    <p>Below are examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Line-height, which is the times of font-size. Syntax: "p {line-height: 3;}". But you can also change it to '1px', '1em', etc. The usual is '1.2em' as common practice, but you can adjust it as you wish.  </li>
            <li>"font-style: italic;", "font-weight: bold;", etc. Check out their details from W3 School site.   </li>
            <li>h1, h2, h3, h4 {font-variant: small-caps;}   </li>
            <li>"font-size: 200%;", or 2em. Or "smaller", (usually around 0.85em, but not precise); or "larger", (1.2 to 1.25em); or "small", "large", "medium", "extra large", ... Be careful when nesting CSS font-size using various CSS styles (like nested CSS lists).   </li>
            <li>"font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, 'Courier New', monospace, cursive, fantasy;". Thanks to M$, Verdana is available to everyone on the web. Usual designs use font-family up to san-sefi. For font name with space in-between, it has to use '' or "" to include them. Courier New is 'modern' font, although used but not very widely. Monospace means every character has same space, as if it comes from a typewritter. So unless you are publish your code, it won't be used in most cases. Cursive and Fantasy is really rarely used, because each and every browser has different interreption of them, esp. the later one. For some poor browser that is not fancy enough, it could use simbles instead (because it is the most close to 'fantasy' style).   </li>
            <li>Font shorthand: it must has size and family at least, and everything before them. "font: bold italic small-caps, smaller Arial, sans-serif;". With the present of the shorthand properties, anything before it would be resetted (so effectively cancelled out all other definitions regarding font before them in the same rule). But you could put them behind the above rule. This one needs to pay attention to.  </li>
            <li>Text Justify. "text-align: right;" (default is 'left', there is another option is 'center'; and "justify" which is line up both left and right using space between the words, which was common used for printing industry).   </li>
            <li>Vertical Align: "vertical-align: sub;" ('sub' is make it lower half line; 'super' makes it half line higher). It could also use '1em' make the height of the line 1em higher, or '-1em' to make it lower 1em lower . Default is 'baseline', which is in the same line as it was. It is useful to present something like 'TM' in top left corner after a brand name, if you use something like "h1 b {vertical-align:0.5em; font-size: 0.7em;} ".               </li>
            <li>Text Transform: "text-transform: uppercase;"; or 'lowercase', 'capitalize', (Safari used to determine 's' in "It's" as a word, so it becomes "It'S". It needs to be tested to see if it is still does this. Most likely not.. ).    </li>
            <li>Text Decoration: "test-decoration: none;"(default is 'none'). Also: "underline", 'overline' (above), 'line-through'(crossed through). BTW, they can be combined using space in-between. Attention for nested boxes: if you placed one such definition to an element, then all its nested child element would get the same deal and you can't cancel it out using 'none' or fake it using same colour as background colour. The definition has to be put on that smallest element that requires it.     </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Margins and Borders to Create White Space and Separation: it is all about those tiny details, that Steve Jobs are really concerned about.</h3>

    <p>This section is to teach the mechnic method of the design, not 'how to do a good design' itself. After watching these videos, I realize that it is really an very detailed and labour-intersive work to decorate every element of the page. This is to appeal to user's emotional side (or 'UX') using very detailed and artistic design by designer/painter/marketer, then get a front end coder to implement it.  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Margin:  "margin-bottom: 1.75em;" (making space between text lines a little bit further); "margin: 0;"(remove margins. there is default margin from CSS point of view. But Browsers does have default settings of margins); "margin-right: 0.5em;"; "margin: 1em 2em 1em 2em;"(clock-wise: top right bottom left. Also this is shorthand). It could also use '33%' instead of '1em', means that it would take 33% of original space. If you got a table with limited width, 'auto' can also be used to create kind of 'center' effect, such as "#post-archive table {width: 80%; margin: 1em auto 0;}". BTW, it could be technically centered, but not 'visibily centered'. And, this does not work before IE5.5. It has to use "text-align: center;" and then adjust instead.  </li>
            <li>"border-right: 0 none;" (there is no space between content and border right , and border-right side has a style of 'none', which means invisible and therefore no weight and other properties). Typically use "border-right: 0;" to cancel out the right separate from the last element of that line from right handsight. "border-bottom: 3px double black;" (replace '1px solid' with '3px double', now it has double underline).   </li>
            <li>How to put a date at the end of the navigation bar (far right), when all those content of the bar is all located at left side of the space? And, no separator between the navigator items and the date. The best way to do it, is to create a new line just for that date which is float to right. The set margin top to '0' (no space between new line and the bar), then set it to '-1em' to see if it could fit in. Then adjust it promptly to make it inline, such as "#today {margin-top: -1.66em;}" to make it perfect. The same technick can be used on margin-left or margin-right, as long as the visual effect is right on the web page.  </li>
            <li>To set things absolutely right across all browsers, use "body {margin: 0; padding: 0;}" to cancel out all other specific settings.  </li>
            <li>Margin Collapsing. By default, paragraph has margin-bottom of '1em' and no padding. Padding of '1em' would typically add '1em' at top and '1em' at bottom, which is no desirable in most cases. To find out, add "border-bottom: 1px dotted red" to space visible, as troubleshooting tool; then get rid of it after all done. On the other hand, same effect could be an issue, when background colour of header or top title has an 1px space between top of the background colour and top of the page. You can set border-top of '1px' to see if it fits into that space or not. The solution is to add 'padding-top: 1px;' or '1em' to get rid of it, depends on how wide the space is.    </li>
            <li>The other thing is the title of sidebar, that could be 'h3' or 1.25em high. The margin bottom by default could be same space as 1.25em (as the size of the font of 'h3'). That space could be just a little wider than desire, and put sidebar content not in line with content right of it. To fix it, add 'margin-top' or 'margin-bottom' of '0.8em' (0.8 x 1.25 = 1) to make the space smaller, and the rest of the sidebar content to be in line with the content of major section.   </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Tables, such as calendar</h3>

    <p>Below are the code, to make the table smaller and centered, and then make the table title (month) back to normal font-size, and looks better visibly. "#post-archive table{font-size: smaller; margin: 0 auto;} #post-archive caption {font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; margin: 1em auto 0;}".  </p>

    <p>Cell Styles. "#post-archive td {border: 1px solid #787A6B; empty-cells: hide; padding: 0;} ". BTW, padding of '5px' would put dates middle of the cell (but, "text-align: center;" would be much better), space between table cells is not 'margin'(cells does not have 'margin' property), but add 'cellspacing' to table tag "<table cellspacing="2">" (because IE5.5 or older does not support 'margin' in table cells). To make the table width wider to be better viewed and occupy most of that box space, you could add "width: 14%"(14% wider). So the final statement of this calendar CSS is: "#post-archive td {border: 1px soid #787A6B; padding: 0; background: #5B5D4E; color: #222; text-align: center; width: 14%;}".   </p>

    <p>What if we want to highlight 'Thu' because of special events once per week? "#post-archive td.thu {background: #686397; border: 1px solid #686397;} #post-archive th.thu {color: #686397;}". First statement refer only to td.thu so that it does not have title of 'Thu' included. The second one set table title of 'Thu' colour as the same as the background colour of the dates, so that it is consistant in style.  </p>

    <p>Links inside the table cells. "#post-archive a:hover {background: #ABC240;} #post-archive a {display: block;}", first one means when you hover a mouse over a linked cell, it would change its background colour to make it standout; the second will change that linked cell display style from default 'inline' style to 'block' style, which means the background colour change now will file the whole cell box instead of just the space of the letter(s).    </p>

    <h3>Style for Print</h3>

    <p>When printing directly from a browser for a webpage, it typically won't print the background as default (think about black background with white text as I am working on, it would cost a lot of ink even before half of the page printed). A typical setting in a webpage would be "<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/base.css" media="all" />". The 'media="all" ' part added, will make sure it not only works on screen, but also printing media. It could be changed to 'screen' only, or 'screen, print'. You can also separate media with different style sheet, such as change previous one to 'screen', then add "<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/pr001.css" media="print" />". Now if you do print preview, you will notice a huge difference in printing styles.  </p>

    <p>To create a print preview CSS file, first change original link to base.css with media to 'tty' from 'screen', so that it won't be used (no one use tty for style sheet); then change the second link media from 'print' to 'screen', which effectively make your screen as your print preview; to facilate printing style sheet design. The design would be:<br /><br />
            body {
                font: 12pt "Times New Roman", TimesNR, Times, serif;            // you would see a very different font-family here due to paper/screen difference, also use 'pt' instead on paper (that 'should never used on a screen media');
            }<br />

            a img {
                border: 0;              // turn the img border off;
            }<br />

            #content img.illus {
                float: left;
                margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;          // float to left of the page, with 1em margin from top, right, bottom, but not left;
            }<br />

            #navlink, #search, #post-archive, #tea-of-the-day img{
                display: none;              // we don't need to print them on paper. They are convenient to be used on screen only;
            }<br />                           // So we are going to hide these for printing: navigation bar, search box, calendar, tea-of-the-day image (but not text);<br /><br />

            // Below are the improvements for printing on paper, which is a different media than 'screen', of course.<br />
            #mashead {
                border-bottom: 1px soid #000;           // Never rely on colour -- that special colour could be run-out on the printer they are using, or they only use mono printers, low resolution one, cheapest one, ... etc;
            }<br />

            h1, h2, h3, h4 {
                font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;
            }<br />

            #today {
                text-align: right;                      // This is the date of today element, prefer to be at right side of title of the article;
                font-style: italic;                      // '-1em' to bring it up to the line of page title; also 0.25em to push border-bottom/underline nto too close (to look better);
                margin: -1em 0 0.25em;
            }<br />

            #content {
                margin: 0 5%;            // to make the main content margin of 5% both left and right, to make it looks better;
            }<br />

            #content h1 {
                margin: -5%             // Title of main content section (not title of the page) back to original left 0 position (cancel out previous rule effect);
            }<br />

            #tea-of-the-day {
                border: 3px double;             // double-lined box to engulf the section;
                text-align: center;                // set the text in the middle;
                padding: 0.5em;                 // inside border with half font-size space, to look better;
                margin: 0 10%;                  // make the whole box 10% margin left and right, so standout from the rest of the main content (5% margin);
            }<br />

            #tea-of-the-day h3, #tea-of-the-day h4 {
                margin: 0;                          // no margin so that to shrink the empty space, to make the box smaller;
                display: inline;                    // instead of two lines of title, make it one line only;
                font-size: 1em;                    // instead of h3 and h4 size, make it normal 1em size. So h3 and h4 now just a DOM tag now;
            }<br />

            #tea-of-the-day h3 {
                border-right: 2px solid;        // add an separate between h3 and h4 elements;
                margin-right: 1em;
                padding-right: 1em;             // spacing of 1em left & right of the separator
                color: gray;                            // also change h3 text colour to gray, to further separate it out of h4 content/title;
            }<br />

            #tea-of-the-day p {
                margin: 0.5em 0 0;              // shrink top margin to half of default, cancel out left, right, and bottom margin, so that to make the box smaller and looks better;
            }<br /><br />

            // Footer changes;<br />
            #footer {
                border-top: 1px solid;          // have a separation line above the footer, to make it look better;
                margin-top: 2em;
                padding-top: 0.25em;
                font-style: italic;
                font-size: smaller;
                text-align: right;              // smaller footer align right of the page with italic font, with margin and padding for spacing concerned of separator line;
                color: gray;
            }<br />

            #footer p {
                margin: 0;
            }<br />
    </p>

    <p>Now save the CSS file, and change original CSS style media: 'screen' changes to 'print', and 'tty' changes to 'screen'. All finished and done!  </p>

        <li>// Background colour to separate this box out of others, then set padding-top of 1px just in case, but also allow it not to stick to the browser top frame. Little space from the bottom of the box looks better.<br />

        <li>// there is a small icon (non-repeated) at the right side of the header section title bar, that balanced out left right.

        </li>
        <li>// By using 'inline' for 'display', it turns a vertical ordered list into one line of navigation list instead. Also I missed to turn 'gont-weight' to 'bold'. 'border-right' adds the separator between navigation items, plus 'margin-right' and 'padding-right' adjust the spacing between fonts and the separator.<br />
            #navlinks li {
                display: inline;
                margin-right: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.75em;

        </li>
        <li>// Hacking function (which is not desired CSS usage, but works perfectly here): set 'margin-top' as '-1.66em', to make it get into the previous line of texts, with usual color, spacing, font-weight(as bold to be consistant to the rest of line for text). 'text-align' to right to turn it as the last item of the navigation line. <br />
            #today {

            }<br />
            // The difference between 'float' and 'text-align': 'float' moves the boxes and a batch of objects; 'text-align' moves text inside the box and usually one word at each time.<br />

    </ol>
    <ol><span id="examples">Step 4: set up the Content Section of the web page. This is the major or 'structure' part of the web page, that people typically use grid to design the layout of the page, lining up every corner and box models. It is layered boxes: big box contains a number of small boxes, that each and every one of them has their own small secrets. Liking painting on the paper, you got to take care of every small nitty-gritty detail, even font-size of 12px as average to 13px as average (due to mobile screen and/or larger &. higher resolution monitors). Check out those discussions on typical grid tempates (current trend is 968 x whatever instead of old 960 x 480 grid as design basis). </span><br /><br />
        <li>// Another hacking example: that now people saying that it is better to put all those hacking configurations into a separate CSS file, to remind yourself what was not 'normal', and why you have to do it this way. It 'could' benefit yourself if you have to maintain this web page in the future (to make reading and understanding easier). <br />
           #content {
                float: left;

            }<br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>// Decorate the H1 header title of the content section.  '-2em' makes the title box closer to the navigation bar, that has the date lifted up '-1.66em' before. Otherwise it looks too far away or 'too loose'. Pay attention to the background colour of white, that set the box visible yet not too much when comparing with the content background colour(Actually it is 'body' background colour). The font-size definition make 'h1' a pure HTML tag now, as well as colour definition for 'h1 b' emphasis.<br />
            #content h1 {
                margin: 0 33% 1.25em -2em; padding: 0.5em 2em;

    <ol><span id="examples">Step 5: set up the subtitle Section of the content section area global settings, as well as inserted image position.</span><br /><br />
        <li>// Change font-size to be consistant, and add a separation line, with spacing adjustment around that line. This successfully separate the title section to the main page content section, yet 'subtle' way. <br />

        <li>// There are several parts here. Add a comment to CSS file is a good way to document the sections to make it more meaningful. But I didn't put them into this note before. Now is a good time to do so. Also it has a hack again, to make '-18em' correspending to '20em' padding of content area. It is a really good way to make those two boxes parallel. But I am sure that now there would be much better way to make that happen. <br />

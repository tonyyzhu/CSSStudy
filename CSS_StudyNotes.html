    <p>This course is from 2006, which is really old. It suggested to install Web Developers Toolbar into Firefox</p>
    <p>Well, I installed the "Web Developer Tools" after Firebug. This tools is the native Firefox tool, which is in the same fashion as Firebug. I can't see any advantage of using it instead of Firebug...</p>
    <p>BTW, the machine becomes slow after I installed the HP device drivers for this Vista laptop. It improves the screen size from 1024x600, to 1328x768, which is great. But, the fan of CPU runs all the time, and 1GB RAM used more than 83% all the time.  </p>
    <p>What I added are standard software for a Windows Laptop:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Microsoft Security Essentials</li>
    	<li>CCleaner</li>
    	<li>Firefox</li>
    	<li>Chrome</li>
    	<li>Notepad++</li>
    	<li>Sublime Text 3059</li>
    	<li>7zip</li>
    	<li>Foxit Reader</li>
    	<li>Time Doctor Pro</li>
    	<li>VLC Player</li>
    	<li>GitHub for Windows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From above, the GitHub Shell does not work. I also tried GitHub ATOM, which does not work as well. It recommended to be installed using 'cocco', which requires M$ PowerShell (that I didn't install) and Chrome(which is why I installed Chrome here, otherwise I won't). And, I didn't port all my Google settings back to this laptop, because I intend to use it as a study tool only, not a daily usage tool.</p>
